## 游붃Articles & Tutorials

1. [Four Kinds of Optimization](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2023/four_kinds_of_optimisation.html)

A highly recommended article. The body of the article introduces four approaches to optimization: using better algorithms, using better data structures, using a lower-level programming language, and accepting less precise solutions. The beginning and end of the article put forward some lessons: we tend to be overly optimistic about performance optimization problems, we may sacrifice correctness for performance, we should not make premature and complex optimizations, and the breadth of optimization is more important than the depth of optimization.

2. [Two Thread Pools, and Why Do We Need Them?](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/two-thread-pools/)

Due to the GIL limitation, when using thread pools in Python, we need to be aware of whether the workload is CPU-bound or IO-bound, which leads to different choices on the number of threads and the target of the thread pool.

3. [It's Time for a Change: datetime.utcnow() Is Now Deprecated](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/it-s-time-for-a-change-datetime-utcnow-is-now-deprecated)

The `utcnow()` and `utcfromtimestamp()` methods of `datetime.datetime` are marked as "deprecated" in Python 3.12 and will be removed in a future version. The article discusses their drawbacks and explains why they are being deprecated. The replacements are `datetime.now()` and `datetime.fromtimestamp()` respectively.

4. [Deploying Python Web Applications](https://www.biaodianfu.com/python-web-server-deployment.html)

This article introduces how to deploy Flask applications using different solutions such as Nginx+Gunicorn+Supervisor, Nginx+uWSGI+Supervisor, Waitress, and Meinheld, and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages.

5. [Python GIL's Changing "Guarantees"](https://stefan-marr.de/2023/11/python-global-interpreter-lock/)

This article introduces the implementation details of the CPython Global Interpreter Lock and the changes between Python 3.9 and the current 3.13 development version. One big difference is that in 3.9 and earlier, the GIL is released when executing many bytecodes, while in 3.13, only a small number of bytecodes are checked to see if the GIL is released.

6. [Django Dependency Management with pip-compile and pip-tools](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-dependency-management-pip-compile-and-pip-t)

There are many options for dependency management in Python, and this article introduces the combination of pip-compile and pip-tools.

7. [Types of Errors in Python Apps](https://threeofwands.com/the-types-of-errors-in-python-apps/)

The author categorizes bugs in programs into four types: type errors and linting errors, import-time exceptions, runtime exceptions, and silent errors. The strategy for handling them is to reduce the occurrence of later types of errors by transforming them into earlier types of errors.

8. [How Many Python Core Devs Use Type Hints?](https://blog.orsinium.dev/posts/py/core-devs-typing/)

Type hints are gaining popularity in Python, but how prevalent are they among core developers? The author analyzed the data and found that, of all core developers, about 53% have recent open-source contributions, and of those, 39% use type hints. Of those who joined the team in the last 3 years, 76% use type hints.

9. [Trying to Convert a Flask Project to Quart Using Python's ast Module](https://juejin.cn/post/7304706387645071395)

The author wanted to use asynchronous iterators returned by OpenAI, so he refactored his Flask project, which didn't support asynchronous operations, to Quart, which does. However, manually modifying the code would have been too time-consuming, so he came up with the idea of using AST parsing to modify the code and improve the efficiency of the project conversion.

10. [A Visual Explanation of Python's NumPy Library](https://solothought.com/tutorial/python-numpy/)

The article uses a lot of intuitive graphics to illustrate the distribution of NumPy data and the process of data transformation, making it easy to understand NumPy data manipulation.

11. [Composition vs Inheritance: I Beg to Differ](https://coady.github.io/posts/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

The traditional view is that composition is better than inheritance, but the author argues that Python doesn't support composition very well, and that using composition dogmatically can lead to problems. Therefore, the author provides a simple implementation approach.

12. [Choosing the Right Data Dashboard Tool: The Unique Strengths of Streamlit and Shiny](https://python-bloggers.com/2023/10/choosing-the-right-data-dashboard-tool-the-unique-strengths-of-streamlit-and-shiny/)

In an era where data drives critical decision-making, interactive dashboards have become indispensable tools in industries such as business and scientific research. Streamlit and Shiny (including RShiny and PyShiny) are powerful frameworks, and this article introduces their respective advantages.
