# Python Trending Weekly #77: Is Python Dependency Management a Dumpster Fire?


## [🦄Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1、[Python Dependency Management is a Dumpster Fire](https://nielscautaerts.xyz/python-dependency-management-is-a-dumpster-fire.html)

This article dives into the complexity of Python dependency management and how projects can easily catch "fire" as they grow and evolve. It shares numerous techniques, tools, and best practices to improve "fire safety," analyzes the pros and cons of different tools, and provides usage recommendations for various scenarios.

2、[The Bloat of Python: A Fine-Grained Analysis of Inter-Project Dependencies](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660821)

A paper from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) that analyzes the source code of 1,302 popular Python open-source projects and their 3,232 transitive dependencies. It builds a fine-grained project dependency graph, performs reachability analysis, and discovers that over 50% of dependencies are bloated.

3、[Sharing My Django Project Template](https://david.guillot.me/en/posts/tech/proposal-for-a-django-project-template/)

The author shares a Django project template based on uv and just, covering recommended directory structures, configuration management, environment variables and secrets management, web UI, deployment, and maintenance.

4、[Avoiding Counting in Django Pagination](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-avoid-counting/)

Django's default Paginator relies on `COUNT(*)` queries to calculate page numbers, which can be time-consuming. This article explains how to implement custom paginators to improve pagination API query performance. The example demonstrated improves from 855ms to 12ms.

5、[You Should Probably Pay Attention to Tokenizers](https://cybernetist.com/2024/10/21/you-should-probably-pay-attention-to-tokenizers/)

When building AI applications, text needs to be tokenized. The author discovered that tokenizer selection and optimization are crucial for RAG effectiveness. The article discusses different tokenizer types (word-based, character-based, and subword) and their impact on model performance.

6、[Pythonic Emptiness Checking](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/the-pythonic-emptiness)

PEP-8 recommends checking if a list is empty using "if seq" rather than "if len(seq)." Some argue the first method is ambiguous. This article refutes that viewpoint, advocating for meaningful variable names, type hints, clear function names, and docstrings to improve code readability and reduce ambiguity.

7、[Attestations: A New Generation of Signatures on PyPI](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/11/14/attestations-a-new-generation-of-signatures-on-pypi/)

PyPI introduces a security feature from PEP-740 specification: digital attestations. It improves upon traditional PGP signatures by enhancing key availability, index verifiability, cryptographic strength, and provenance attributes.

8、[PyPIM: New Method to Execute Python Code Directly in RAM](https://www.techspot.com/news/105557-pypim-new-method-execute-python-code-directly-ram.html)

Israeli researchers [developed](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-11-software-package-bypass-cpu-efficient.html) a new software "platform" that converts easy-to-read Python instructions into low-level machine code and executes it directly in RAM without going through the CPU. This new Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture significantly improves code performance.

9、[A Practical Example of the Pipeline Pattern in Python](https://pybit.es/articles/a-practical-example-of-the-pipeline-pattern-in-python/)

The Pipeline pattern, also known as the Chain of Command pattern. This article presents an example using `functools.reduce`, `partial` functions, and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse HTML content, explaining the usage and benefits of this pattern.

10、[Zero-Downtime Django Deployments with Multistep Database Changes](https://johnnymetz.com/posts/multistep-database-changes/)

Blue-green deployment is a common strategy to prevent service downtime during deployments. This article explores what blue-green deployment is, why modifying databases during blue-green deployment can be tricky, and how to handle common database changes using a Django project as an example.

11、[Netflix's Investigation of a Workbench UI Latency Issue](https://netflixtechblog.com/investigation-of-a-workbench-ui-latency-issue-faa017b4653d)

Workbench is a remote development workspace launched by Netflix that recently experienced slow and unresponsive JupyterLab UI issues. This article reviews the detailed troubleshooting process, from UI debugging all the way down to the Linux kernel.

12、[ML in Go with a Python Sidecar](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/ml-in-go-with-a-python-sidecar/)

How to use machine learning models in Go projects? This article covers several approaches, including using existing LLM APIs, running open-source models locally, and integrating trained models through a Python sidecar pattern. The article focuses on explaining and demonstrating the last approach.
