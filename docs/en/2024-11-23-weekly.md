# Python Trending Weekly #78: Why async/await Might Be a Terrible Design Choice


## [🦄Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1、[Playground Wisdom: Threads Beat Async/Await](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/11/18/threads-beat-async-await/)

The author argues that async/await is a terrible abstraction for most programming languages, and threads are the superior approach. While it rescued us from callback hell, it introduced new headaches like "colored functions" and backpressure challenges that block us from achieving straightforward, intuitive concurrency. The piece suggests new language designs should adopt virtual thread models similar to Java's Loom project. (Bonus: The article repeatedly references this classic piece [I'm not feeling the async pressure](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-01-11-flask))

2、[Is Python Really That Slow?](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/is-python-really-that-slow)

This performance comparison pits Python against Node.js and Rust using Fibonacci calculations and bubble sort benchmarks. The results? Python 3.11 shows significant improvements over its predecessor, while PyPy nearly matches Node.js in speed. The author is genuinely impressed by Python's recent performance gains and surprised by PyPy's capabilities.

3、[Django Async: Ready for Prime Time? ](https://jonathanadly.com/is-async-django-ready-for-prime-time)

What should you watch out for when going full async with Django? This comprehensive guide covers everything from ASGI web servers and async views to async ORM, API calls, and middleware. The verdict? Async Django is production-ready—here's what you need to know before making the switch.

4、[Why Durable Execution Should Be Lightweight](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/what-is-lightweight-durable-execution)

Durable execution lets your workflows survive crashes, restarts, and interruptions by restoring to their exact previous state. DBOS's lightweight implementation uses Postgres to store workflow states and step outputs, enabling features like durable sleep, messaging, and queues while dramatically simplifying development, deployment, and maintenance.

5、[Python 中管道模式——通过重载运算符实现](https://un4gt.github.io/python/python_some_tips/python_pipeline.html)

Last week we saw pipeline patterns implemented with reduce and lambda functions. This approach takes it further by overloading operators, making the syntax feel much closer to Linux's native pipe operators. (Shared by @un4gt)

6、[FireDucks : Pandas but 100x faster](https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/fireducks-pandas-but-100x-faster/)

8、[PEP 765 – Disallow return/break/continue that exit a finally block](https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/)

A new PEP draft proposes banning return/break/continue statements that exit finally blocks. Why? They swallow exceptions and can override return values from try clauses, leading to subtle bugs that are hard to track down.

Packed with optimization tips including GC threshold tuning, weak references, and data structure optimization strategies.

10、[The Practical Guide to Scaling Django](https://slimsaas.com/blog/django-scaling-performance/)

The author advocates for eliminating bottlenecks incrementally as your system grows. This practical guide covers common optimization strategies including query optimization, database indexing, queryset optimization, view-level caching, template fragment caching, low-level cache APIs, async views with background tasks, and load balancing techniques.

11、[SQL, Homomorphisms and Constraint Satisfaction Problems](https://www.philipzucker.com/sql_graph_csp/)

SQL isn't just for database queries—it can solve surprisingly complex problems like Sudoku puzzles and programming challenges. This article demonstrates SQL's power in tackling graph homomorphisms and constraint satisfaction problems, often outperforming pure Python solutions.

12、[Pleasant debugging with GDB and DDD](https://begriffs.com/posts/2022-07-17-debugging-gdb-ddd.html)

GDB might be the venerable Linux/BSD debugger, but it's far from outdated. Learn how to customize GDB interfaces, configure DDD, master debugging techniques, and leverage GDB's Python API to create helper functions and beautiful pretty-printers that make debugging actually enjoyable.
