# Python Trending Weekly #79: Python's Metadata Dilemma

## [🦄Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1、[Constraints are Good: Python's Metadata Dilemma](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/11/26/python-packaging-metadata/)

The author argues that Python's metadata system is overly complex and suffers from a "lack of constraints." Comparing it with JavaScript, the article highlights several issues with Python metadata: complicated metadata access, the need to regenerate metadata, unclear cache invalidation, and parser inefficiency caused by dynamic metadata.

2、[Talk Python rewritten in Quart (async Flask)](https://talkpython.fm/blog/posts/talk-python-rewritten-in-quart-async-flask/)

The Talk Python website was built in 2015 using the Pyramid framework, but that framework has stagnated. The article discusses various popular Python web frameworks, explains why they weren't chosen, why Quart (async Flask) was selected, and details the migration process.

3、[Python isn't just glue, it's an implicit JIT ecosystem](https://state.smerity.com/smerity/state/01JC39KW1TBEAZTKJJF0BR5ZXD)

In traditional JIT compilation, programs optimize their hot paths (frequently executed code sections) at runtime. The author discovered that Python's community ecosystem does something remarkably similar—when performance bottlenecks persist on certain paths, the ecosystem optimizes those paths.

4、[Python type hints may not be for me in practice](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/TypeHintsMaybeNotForMe)

The author experimented with Python type hints but found that the benefits don't outweigh the hassle. For occasional small, single-person Python projects, you can indeed get away without worrying much about type hints. (Note: The author also wrote [Some of my experiences with Python type hints and mypy](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/TypeHintsAndMyPyNotes))

5、[A Comprehensive Guide to Python Project Management and Packaging: Concepts Illustrated with uv – Part II](https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-concepts-illustrated-with-uv-part-2/)

This popular series uses uv to introduce Python project management. This is part two, covering project building and release workflows, including build systems, source trees, build front-end/back-end interfaces, editable installations, custom build processes, and how to handle dependencies and metadata.

6、[How Much Memory Do You Need in 2024 to Run 1 Million Concurrent Tasks?](https://hez2010.github.io/async-runtimes-benchmarks-2024/)

The author benchmarked memory usage for concurrent tasks using coroutines in Rust, C#, NodeJS, Python, Go, and Java, testing how these languages perform with 1, 10K, 100K, and 1M tasks. (Note: The author also did a similar comparison last year [How much memory is needed to run 1 million concurrent tasks in different languages?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s14ltHH_MZ4E6YZgP233Lw))

7、[Pushing the boundaries of Streamlit](https://twitchard.github.io/posts/2024-11-27-streamlit.html)

The author shares their experience developing web UIs with Streamlit, discussing challenges encountered when integrating voice interfaces and handling long-running tasks, and explaining how they overcame these obstacles through custom components and multithreading.

8、[Using GitHub Actions to run a Python script](https://mechanicalgirl.com/post/using-gitHub-actions-run-python-script/)

The author shares their experience using GitHub Actions for automation, focusing on GitHub Actions workflow configuration, how to invoke Python scripts, and implementing their own automation tasks.

9、[Solving Boolean satisfiability and integer programming with Python packaging](https://mmaaz.ca/writings/pipip.html)

Inspired by Python packaging solving Sudoku problems, the author developed a solver called pipip that uses Python package dependency resolvers to solve Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and 0/1 integer programming (IP) problems. The article explains the principles, implementation details, and usage examples in detail.

10、[Squashing Django Migrations Easily](https://jacklinke.com/squashing-django-migrations-the-easy-way)

The author's Django project has been running for 6 years with nearly 300 modules, making migration risk reduction a challenge. The article introduces using django-model-info to generate migration graphs, identifying safe migration paths for squashing, and how the entire process reduced migration file count and optimized deployment time.

11、[These Languages are Accumulating](https://jcarroll.com.au/2024/11/28/these-languages-are-accumulating/)

The more programming languages you learn, the deeper your understanding becomes. The author compares how Python, R, Haskell, APL, and Julia implement cumulative operations (like `accumulate` and `cumsum`), showing the diversity in how they solve the same problems.

12、[不同语言的 10 亿次嵌套循环迭代对比图](https://benjdd.com/languages)

More than 10 programming languages executing 1 billion nested loops—the execution time was made into an animation. Watching Python crawling at the bottom is genuinely frustrating...
