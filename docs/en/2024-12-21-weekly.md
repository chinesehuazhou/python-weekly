# Python Weekly #82: How the CIA Uses Python?

## [🦄 Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1、[How the CIA Writes Python](https://compileralchemy.substack.com/p/how-the-cia-writes-python)

The CIA uses Python for everything from hacking to building utility tools, with a surprising preference for versions 2.7 and 3.4. This article compiles the agency's Python practices, covering their adherence to Google's Python Style Guide, using `pip2tgz` for package downloads, maintaining a local PyPI, their PyCharm + pyenv setup, running tests on remote servers, and their CLI script templates.

2、[From Chaos to Order: An Analysis of Python Dependency Management Tools](https://www.cnblogs.com/wang_yb/p/18617458)

Python's dependency management landscape is... diverse, to say the least. This post breaks down the pros and cons of 13 different tools. The author's TL;DR? If you just need Python packages, go with `uv` and `pipx`. If you're juggling multiple isolated environments, stick to the `pip` + `venv` + `pip-tools` + `pyenv` combo.

3、[Tip of the Day: Why I Hate LangChain](https://kingname.info/2024/12/14/hate-langchain/)

The author has a serious bone to pick with LangChain and LlamaIndex, seeing them as poster children for over-abstraction. The article cites LlamaIndex's use of dependency injection as a nightmare for customization. It also draws a comparison with SimpleMind (from the creator of `requests`) to show what a clean, non-over-engineered implementation looks like. (Bonus: Octomind's take on [Why We No Longer Use LangChain for Building Our AI Agents](https://www.octomind.dev/blog/why-we-no-longer-use-langchain-for-building-our-ai-agents))

4、[Build a DNS Server in Python](https://xer0x.in/dns-server-in-python/)

5、[Top Python Web Frameworks for 2025](https://reflex.dev/blog/2024-12-20-python-comparison/)

A comparative analysis of the heavy hitters in the Python web framework arena: Reflex, Django, Flask, Gradio, Streamlit, Dash, and FastAPI. What are their strengths and weaknesses? Let's find out.

6、[Python Meta-Circular Interpreter](https://rahul.gopinath.org/post/2019/12/07/python-mci/)

A meta-circular interpreter is an interpreter for a language written in that language itself. Why bother? It gives you insane control over code execution and makes tracing a breeze. This long-form article details exactly what you can do with one and how to build it.

7、[Should You Ditch Spark for DuckDB or Polars?](https://milescole.dev/data-engineering/2024/12/12/Should-You-Ditch-Spark-DuckDB-Polars.html)

With lightweight engines like DuckDB and Polars gaining traction, is it time to say goodbye to Spark? This article benchmarks them across performance, execution cost, dev cost, and maturity. Spoiler: Spark still holds the crown for scalability and cost-efficiency, so don't delete it just yet.

8、[Django Security: The Neglected Default Hardenings](https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/django-security-hardenings-that-are-not-happening/)

A case study on a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability caused by a Django misconfiguration. Some of Django's default behaviors can open up security holes. Despite the author's efforts being marked "wontfix," this post is a call to action for developers to be aware of these potential risks and push for official fixes.

9、[Displaying Website Content on an E-Ink Display](https://mfasold.net/blog/displaying-website-content-on-an-e-ink-display/)

To avoid constantly checking his phone, the author built an e-ink display for his son's school timetable. The stack? Playwright + Pillow to capture and convert content, Werkzeug for a simple web service, and Arduino to handle auto-wake and image updates.

10、[A Circular Reference Caused by Monkeypatching](https://frostming.com/2024/circular-ref-monkeypatch/)

A seemingly innocent line like `foo.bar = foo.bar` can create a circular reference and lead to memory leaks. This often happens with monkeypatching. The article shares a neat trick using `weakref` to dodge this bullet.

11、[Why Do Primes Form Spirals in Polar Coordinates?](https://jaketae.github.io/study/prime-spirals/)

Here's a fun question: What happens when you plot prime numbers on a polar coordinate system? Using `sympy` to generate primes and `matplotlib` to visualize them, the author reveals a beautiful pattern. But what's the math behind it?

The first 10,000 primes plotted.

12、[What's the Deal with Claude's MCP (Model Context Protocol)?](https://sspai.com/post/94360)

MCP establishes a secure, two-way link between LLMs and data sources. But what does that actually mean, and what problems does it solve? The author walks through the official examples, explains the data interaction process, and tests it with real datasets. Verdict: It's actually pretty useful. (Bonus: [Reflections on Building with MCP](https://outlore.dev/blog/model-context-protocol/))
