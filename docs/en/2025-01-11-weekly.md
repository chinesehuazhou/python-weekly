## [🦄 Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1、[Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to "write better code"? ](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)

The author wanted to experiment with improving AI programming quality by continuously asking large models to write better code. After multiple iterations, they managed to improve a simple programming task's performance by 100x! This shows us the importance of prompt engineering and the potential of LLMs in code optimization. I'll definitely try this next time...

2、[Python Concurrency: Threads, Processes, and asyncio Explained](https://newvick.com/python-concurrency/)

This article introduces the three main approaches to Python concurrent programming: threads, processes, and asyncio. Using practical code examples and performance tests, it analyzes their pros and cons, showcasing the characteristics and applicable scenarios of each method.

3、[Why is hash(-1) == hash(-2) in Python? ](https://omairmajid.com/posts/2021-07-16-why-is-hash-in-python/)

What's going on? In Python, hash(-1) actually equals hash(-2), which is -2? The author dug through Python's official documentation and source code to track down the specific implementation of the `hash` function and finally found the reason: C language uses -1 to indicate error return values, so the hash() function might return -1 on error. If it correctly returns -1 as well, it would be confusing, so they agreed to use -2 as a replacement...

4、[Run Python in Your Browser Effortlessly](https://kai.bi/post/run-python-programs-easily-in-the-browser)

The author used Cloudflare's Python Workers to turn Microsoft's recently open-sourced MarkItDown into a website. It leverages Pyodide, which uses WebAssembly to port CPython, enabling Python to run in browsers.

5、[PEP 769 – Add a 'default' keyword argument to 'attrgetter' and 'itemgetter' ](https://peps.python.org/pep-0769/)

A new proposal suggesting adding a `default` keyword argument to the `attrgetter` and `itemgetter` functions in the `operator` module, so they can return default values when target attributes or items are missing, avoiding exceptions and simplifying code.

6、[Python Packaging: Why we can't have nice things, Part 2](https://zahlman.github.io/posts/2025/01/07/python-packaging-2/)

pipx is a useful Python package management tool. The article introduces its uses and some limitations, but mainly shares three tips for improving pipx efficiency: managing environments through "injecting" dependencies, using pipx's built-in pip for installations, and installing pipx itself through pipx to get updates.

7、[Django vs. FastAPI, An Honest Comparison](https://www.david-dahan.com/blog/comparing-fastapi-and-django)

Compares these two Python frameworks across multiple dimensions, including batteries included, architecture, backend vs full-stack, ease of use/learning curve, modernity, performance, ORM and configuration. As for which to choose, it still depends on project requirements.

8、[Weak references and garbage collectors](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/weakrefs/)

The author once participated in developing a Python interpreter called Skybison, which used a moving garbage collector that organizes memory by moving objects and updating pointers. The article explains how to handle weak reference objects during garbage collection and how to implement this in custom garbage collectors.

9、[AI-text-to-video-model-from-scratch: build a small scale text-to-video model from scratch](https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/AI-text-to-video-model-from-scratch)

How do you implement a text-to-video model from scratch? The article provides detailed coverage of relevant theoretical concepts, GAN architecture, model training, implementing specific functions (text embedding layers, generator layers, discriminator layers, etc.), and using the trained model to generate AI videos.

10、[Python for DevOps](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/python-for-devops/)

Python can flexibly develop projects and also build long-term infrastructure. The article introduces 15 libraries used in DevOps work, including Django and Flask for developing web dashboards, Schedule and Airflow for task scheduling, Scapy for network analysis, and Docker SDK and Dagger for containerization and cloud interaction, among others.

11、[Building an Anemia Detection System Using Machine Learning](https://dev.to/yogesh10/building-an-anemia-detection-system-using-machine-learning-368i)

Anemia affects millions of people worldwide, and traditional detection methods are time-consuming, so the author developed a system that can quickly assess and accurately predict anemia. The project uses scikit-learn to implement a random forest classifier, develops a web interface based on Flask, and the code is open source.

12、[Google Releases AI Agent Technology White Paper](https://arthurchiao.art/blog/ai-agent-white-paper-zh/)

What's the difference between Agents and large models? The hallmark that distinguishes humans from animals is tool use, and Agents are large models that can use tools. Introduces how Agents work, what reasoning frameworks they use, different tool types, improving model performance through targeted learning, and rapidly developing Agents based on LangChain.
