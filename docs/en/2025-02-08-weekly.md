3、[The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/bytesio-reduce-memory-usage/)

`io.BytesIO` is Python's class for handling byte data in memory, supporting file-like object read and write operations. The author points out that its read() method increases memory usage and compares two methods that can optimize memory usage: BytesIO.getbuffer() and BytesIO.getvalue().

4、[Monkeypatching](https://radiac.net/blog/2025/01/monkeypatching-django/)

The author developed a single-file Django framework called nanodjango. The article introduces how it's implemented through "monkey patching" techniques, explaining how to cleverly modify Django library's core mechanisms to simplify it into a single-file form.

5、[Decorator JITs - Python as a DSL](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/decorator-jits-python-as-a-dsl/)

JIT decorator patterns dynamically compile functions into optimized machine code, using tools like LLVM for compilation and execution. The article demonstrates three implementation strategies: AST-based JIT, bytecode-based JIT, and trace-based JIT, explaining their implementation principles and specific cases (Triton, Numba, JAX).

6、[Python - Rewriting the AST For Durable Execution](https://autokitteh.com/technical-blog/hacking-the-import-system-and-rewriting-the-ast-for-durable-execution)

Durable execution refers to persistently storing code execution state (such as variable values, function call results, etc.) so that execution can resume after program restart or interruption. The article introduces modifying AST to intercept function calls, supporting durable execution without changing original code logic.

7、[Portable Python Bundles on Windows](https://dev.to/treehouse/portable-python-bundles-on-windows-41ac)

Packaging and distributing Python applications on Windows isn't convenient, and tools like pyinstaller and py2exe aren't always suitable. The article proposes a flexible solution similar to virtual environments that can be transferred between machines, requires no additional tools, and is independent of dependency paths.

8、[Python Rgonomics - 2025 Update](https://www.emilyriederer.com/post/py-rgo-2025/)

Switching languages equals switching mindsets—not just syntax. The article shares excellent tools from the Python community for R language users, including IDEs, environment management, data analysis, and table creation.

9、[Language Translation with Python](https://tech.marksblogg.com/language-translation-ai-python.html)

LibreTranslate is a lightweight API service based on Argos Translate that supports text detection and translation. The article introduces its service deployment and Python implementation, as well as how to manage large models and optimize performance.

10、[py-free-threading](https://py-free-threading.github.io/)

This is a series of articles about Python free threading, covering how to install and run GIL-disabled Python, port Python packages to support free threading, set up CI, testing and debugging, etc.

11、[Differences Between Python Gaming Libraries](https://www.askpython.com/resources/python-gaming-libraries-differences)

There are quite a few Python libraries available for game development. The article provides a checklist and comparison of their pros and cons, including Pygame, Pyglet, Arcade, Panda3D, Ursina, and Cocos2d.

12、[Looking at Django task runners and queues](https://www.loopwerk.io/articles/2025/django-task-queues)

What are the pros and cons of different task queues and task scheduling tools, and what choices are available in Django projects? The author identifies shortcomings of django-mailer and django-apscheduler, providing four solutions: django-tasks, django-q2, cron, and celery, with code examples and reference configurations.
